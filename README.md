üöÄ User Registration & Medical Requisition System

üåü Project Overview
Welcome to the User Registration & Medical Requisition System! This cutting-edge project leverages the power of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to simplify and streamline user registration and medical requisition processes. With this system, users can effortlessly register by uploading official documents, which are then analyzed to extract key details like name, birth date, and CPF (Brazilian individual taxpayer registry). Once registered, users can submit medical requisitions, and the system will automatically generate and display a comprehensive report with all relevant exam information.

üî• Key Features
